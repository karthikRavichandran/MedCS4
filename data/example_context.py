context1 = '''The purpose of the memorandum is to exchange information and expertise 
in the area of occupational safety and health. One product of this agreement is the 
development of documents to provide the scientific basis for establishing recommended 
occupational exposure limits. These limits will be developed separately by the two 
countries according to their different national policies. This document on the health 
effects of occupational exposure to acrylamide is the fourth product of that 
agreement. The document was written by Vlasta Molak, Ph.D., D.A.B.T. (DSDTT/NIOSH), 
and was reviewed by the Criteria Group and by DSDTT/NIOSH.# BACKGROUND\n\n# CHEMICAL 
AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES\nAcrylamide is an odorless, white, crystalline solid used as 
a monomer or as a raw material in the production of polyacrylamides and other 
compounds. Chemical and physical properties of acrylamide are given in Table 1. 
Because most of the aciylamide monomer is produced and used as an aqueous solution, 
the physical properties of a 50% aqueous solution of acrylamide are also given (Table 
2).'''


example_inf_cn = '''A 51-year-old hypertensive Pakistani male patient was admitted in 
the cardiac intensive care unit in King Fahd University Hospital on 30 July 2017 
complaining of chest and back pain for two weeks prior to the presentation; he took 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but were not effective. Physical examination was 
done in the emergency department and revealed stable vital signs; the patient was 
conscious, moving all his limbs; there were warm palpable pulses of the upper 
arms.\nThe CTA of the aorta revealed a large dissection flap from the origin of the 
left subclavian artery extending down all the way to the level of renal arteries; 
there was enlargement of the false lumen at the proximal aorta with large aneurysmal 
dilatation (mural thrombus) and a compression of the true lumen (ascending aorta). 
Additionally, there was a large entry point seen 2 cm distal to the right subclavian 
artery. The aberrant right subclavian artery was noted crossing posterior to the 
trachea and arising as a last branch of the aortic arch distal to the left subclavian 
artery; also, the left vertebral artery was arising directly from the aortic arch. 
There was no other evidence of vascular dissection or occlusion below the level of 
the renal arteries (Figures and ).\nThe patient underwent general anesthesia for 
thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) two days after his first day of admission; the 
procedure was done through the right femoral approach; an angiogram was performed 
intraoperatively (). Stent graft with a size of 34 mm Ã— 15 cm was used and deployed 
into the descending thoracic aorta; the intimal entry tear was completely covered by 
the stent, and the false lumen was obliterated. A postdeployment angiogram revealed 
successful proximal occlusion of the entry point with no perfusion of the false lumen 
and good flow through both carotid and left vertebral arteries as well as patent 
right and left subclavian arteries.\nThe patient was postoperatively moving all his 
limbs, and the peripheral pulses were intact. He got discharged one day after the 
surgery and was doing well afterward. We evaluated patient's prognosis by following 
up for 3 to 6 months for a chest X-ray, CTA, and CT aorta 3D reconstruction (Figures 
and ) which confirmed no endovascular leak as well as no ischemic or stroke signs in 
the clinical follow-up; we assessed the patency of the subclavian arteries by 
examining the bilateral upper arms' blood supply in addition to radial arteries by 
evaluating the pulses with no evidence of morbidity.

example_inf_conv = '''Doctor: Hello, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Hi, doctor. I am feeling much better now.
Doctor: I am glad to hear that. Can you tell me about the chest and back pain that brought you here?
Patient: I had been experiencing it for two weeks prior to my presentation.
Doctor: Did you take any medication for it?
Patient: Yes, I took nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but they were not effective.
Doctor: I see. During the physical examination, we found that your vital signs were stable. How were you feeling at that time?
Patient: I was conscious and moving all my limbs.
Doctor: That's great. The CTA of the aorta revealed a large dissection flap from the origin of the left subclavian artery extending down to the level of renal arteries. It also showed enlargement of the false lumen at the proximal aorta with a large aneurysmal dilatation and a compression of the true lumen. Additionally, there was a large entry point seen 2 cm distal to the right subclavian artery.
Patient: Oh my, that sounds serious.
Doctor: Yes, it was. However, we underwent thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) two days after your first day of admission. It was done through the right femoral approach, and a stent graft was used. The intimal entry tear was completely covered by the stent, and the false lumen was obliterated.
Patient: I see. Did the procedure go well?
Doctor: Yes, it did. A postdeployment angiogram revealed successful proximal occlusion of the entry point with no perfusion of the false lumen and good flow through both carotid and left vertebral arteries as well as patent right and left subclavian arteries.
Patient: That's good news. How long do I need to stay here in the intensive care unit?
Doctor: You were discharged one day after the surgery and were doing well afterward. We have evaluated your prognosis and will instruct you on follow-up requirements.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. What should I do next?
Doctor: We will give you instructions on postoperative care and schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your condition.'''
