  This 77-year-old male patient was transferred to our 
  ICU 1 week after his COVID-19 diagnosis due to continuing respiratory decompensation 
  requiring intubation. Following the acute phase, with intermittent proning, 
  the patient continued to be hemodynamically unstable and was difficult to wean. 
  Rehabilitation proved challenging under these conditions, and physical therapists had 
  to reevaluate and adapt their interventions daily according to his condition. After 2 
  weeks, he was tracheotomized and started to improve very slowly. One week after 
  tracheostomy, the patient was able to speak for the first time after a cuff-down 
  trial and with the help of a speaking valve. But the patient spoke only a few words 
  with us and it was often difficult to involve him in exercises. Two days later, 
  he was able to communicate with his relatives via video telephony. This was a very 
  emotional moment for everyone involved, but it improved his communication and he was 
  able to express to his wife that he had no strength left to continue. However, 
  through the familyâ€™s active participation in his early rehabilitation process, 
  they were able to reinforce his confidence and motivation. He was discharged to a 
  rehabilitation clinic severely weak (MRC-SS 40/60) and functionally impaired (CPAx 
  22/50), but continued to progress in slow steps.

  Doctor: Good morning, sir. How are you feeling today?
  
  Patient: Hmm, I'm feeling a bit weak.
  
  Doctor: I see. Can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
  
  Patient: Yes, I was diagnosed with COVID-19 about a week ago.
  
  Doctor: I see. And you were transferred to our ICU due to continuing respiratory 
  decompensation, correct?
  
  Patient: Yes, that's right.
  
  Doctor: And you required intubation?
  
  Patient: Yes, I did.
  
  Doctor: I see. And after the acute phase, you continued to be hemodynamically 
  unstable and it was difficult to wean you off the ventilator, correct?
  
  Patient: Yes, that's correct.
  
  Doctor: And rehabilitation was challenging under these conditions, correct?
  
  Patient: Yes, it was.
  
  Doctor: I see. And after 2 weeks, you underwent tracheostomy and started to improve 
  very slowly, correct?
  
  Patient: Yes, that's correct.
  
  Doctor: And one week after tracheostomy, you were able to speak for the first time 
  with the help of a speaking valve, correct?

  Patient: Yes, that's right.
  
  Doctor: And two days later, you were able to communicate with your relatives via 
  video telephony, correct?
  
  Patient: Yes, I was.
  
  Doctor: I see. And through the family's active participation in your early 
  rehabilitation process, they were able to reinforce your confidence and motivation, 
  correct?
  
  Patient: Yes, they did.
  
  Doctor: And you were discharged to a rehabilitation clinic severely weak, correct?
  
  Patient: Yes, I was.
  
  Doctor: I see. And your MRC-SS was 40/60 and your CPAx was 22/50, correct?
  
  Patient: Yes, that's correct.
