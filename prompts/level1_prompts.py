    ICU 1 week after his COVID-19 diagnosis due to continuing respiratory decompensation 
    requiring intubation. Following the acute phase, with intermittent proning, 
    the patient continued to be hemodynamically unstable and was difficult to wean. 
    Rehabilitation proved challenging under these conditions, and physical therapists had 
    to reevaluate and adapt their interventions daily according to his condition. After 2 
    weeks, he was tracheotomized and started to improve very slowly. One week after 
    tracheostomy, the patient was able to speak for the first time after a cuff-down 
    trial and with the help of a speaking valve. But the patient spoke only a few words 
    with us and it was often difficult to involve him in exercises. Two days later, 
    he was able to communicate with his relatives via video telephony. This was a very 
    emotional moment for everyone involved, but it improved his communication and he was 
    able to express to his wife that he had no strength left to continue. However, 
    through the familyâ€™s active participation in his early rehabilitation process, 
    they were able to reinforce his confidence and motivation. He was discharged to a 
    rehabilitation clinic severely weak (MRC-SS 40/60) and functionally impaired (CPAx 
    22/50), but continued to progress in slow steps.'''
